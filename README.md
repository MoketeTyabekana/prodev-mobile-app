# prodev-mobile-setup

## Objective

Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To ensure a smooth development experience, we will be using the Expo Framework for React Native, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this task, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js LTS** installed
- **VS Code** (our recommended IDE)
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows**
- **Expo Go** installed on your physical device (Android or iOS)

These tools are essential for completing the upcoming projects efficiently.

## Instructions

By now, you should already have Node.js LTS, VS Code, and a compatible operating system installed. This task focuses on setting up Expo Go on your physical device.

### Why Expo Go?

Unlike web development, mobile development relies on device emulators to test applications. However, keeping up with the ever-evolving mobile ecosystem (e.g., iPhone 7 â†’ iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android devices) can be costly in terms of hardware requirements.

Expo Go provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to test and run your React Native applications directly on your physical device, supporting both iOS and Android seamlessly.

## Steps to Install Expo Go

1. Visit the official Expo Go homepage: [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)
2. Select the latest SDK version.
3. Click on **Install** for your device:
	- **Android:** Install from the Google Play Store.
	- **iOS:** Install from the Apple App Store.
4. Open the Expo Go app on your device.
5. Create a new account or log in if you already have one.
