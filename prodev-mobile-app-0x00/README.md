## What Happens When You Reset the App

When you run `npm run reset-project`, the following steps occur:

1. The script prompts: `Do you want to move existing files to /app-example instead of deleting them? (Y/n):`
2. If you choose `Y`, a new `/app-example` directory is created.
3. The script attempts to move the existing `app` directory into `app-example`.
4. If the move operation fails (e.g., due to permissions issues), you will see an error message like:
   - `❌ Error during script execution: EPERM: operation not permitted, rename '...\app' -> '...\app-example\app'`

This process helps you back up your current app files before resetting the project, but you may need to resolve permission issues if the move fails.
# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
